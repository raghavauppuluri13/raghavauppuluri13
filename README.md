## Hey :wave:, I'm Raghava!

I am an undergrad robotics researcher at Purdue, VP at the [Purdue Autonomous Robotics Club](https://www.purduearc.com/), and Software Lead at [Purdue Lunabotics](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~lunabot/).

### What I am excited about
Building robots in the real world with a direct value-add to humans and/or enable exploration ðŸ¤–

### Current Projects
- Researching deformable object manipulation at [Purdue MARS](https://www.purduemars.com) by designing and implementing a grasping pipeline for robot bandaging using visuo-tactile + camera sensor stack and imitation learning
- Building an autonomous lunar robot at Purdue Lunabotics to participate in the NASA Lunabotics competition ([repo](https://github.com/PurdueLunabotics/lunabotics_21), [about](http://wiki.purduelunabotics.org/wiki/software/start-here))
- Building a robot arm at ARC to play chess ([repo](https://github.com/purdue-arc/arc_robot_arm), [about](https://wiki.purduearc.com/wiki/robot-arm/start-here))
