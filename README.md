## Hey :wave:, I'm Raghava!

I am an undergrad robotics researcher at Purdue, VP at the [Purdue Autonomous Robotics Club](https://www.purduearc.com/), and Software Lead at [Purdue Lunabotics](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~lunabot/).

### Current Projects
- Building a smart robot arm at ARC ([repo](https://github.com/purdue-arc/arc_robot_arm), [about](https://wiki.purduearc.com/wiki/robot-arm/start-here))
- Building an autonomous lunar robot at Purdue Lunabotics ([repo](https://github.com/PurdueLunabotics/lunabotics_21))
- Researching deformable object manipulation by designing and implementing a grasping pipeline for robot bandaging using visuo-tactile +
camera sensor stack and sim-to-real and imitation learning approaches, advised by [Dr. Yu She](https://sites.google.com/view/yu-she)

### What I am excited about
Building robots that learn and adapt like humans, ultimately doing harder and harder things that save us time and reduce our stress.
